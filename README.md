# match-tagging-app

Inspired by Nacsport's Tag&View and Picco, the app aims to be a football/soccer match tagger that coaches/analysts/scouts can use to live tag matches or use for post-match tagging. The app is created using JavaScript and React, and will be hosted on Streamlit/GitHub, but for now, there is nothing here.
